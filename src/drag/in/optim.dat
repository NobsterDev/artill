# this is an optimisation plan
# each line represents an optimisation scenario
# each positive number in the line represents 
# the smoother coefficient in the optimisation
# optimisation works sequencially for each number and
# sequentially (or in parallel if implemented) for each scenario
# the scenario with the best result wins
# negative value sets the number of function evaluations for
# the current scenario
